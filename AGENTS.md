# Renivet Python services — Codex / engineering agent rules

**Repository:** Python 3.12+ / FastAPI private advisory services. Read `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, current service boundaries, tests and interfaces before any edit.

**W2 service discipline:** PostgreSQL stock and catalog lifecycle authority belong to the NestJS backend. Python may provide only approved advisory/search or recommendation capabilities behind verified interfaces, never act as an alternative stock/allocation authority or bypass brand permissions.

## Non-negotiable task-to-PR workflow

**The project owner alone reviews, approves and merges PRs. Codex NEVER merges, self-approves, enables auto-merge or pushes directly to `main`.** This is a permanent repo policy, not just a chat preference.

For **every explicitly authorized task**, including docs:
1. Read the live Linear issue, dependencies, acceptance tests and the approved project rules. **One issue at a time; do not start another issue automatically.**
2. Inspect `git status`; do not discard uncommitted changes. Run `git fetch origin`. Create a **fresh issue-named branch from updated `origin/main`**, never from a previous feature branch. If the branch already exists, inspect and choose a unique task branch rather than overwriting it.
3. Implement only the approved scope. Test, conduct adversarial code QA, fix issues and run the required repository checks. Report `PASS`, `FAIL` or `NOT EXECUTED` with evidence; green lint alone is not acceptance.
4. Stage only reviewed files; commit with the Linear ID, push the task branch, and **open a PR against `main`**. Include user story, scope, data/API impact, abuse and failure tests, actual results, CI status, known gaps and relevant release gates.
5. **STOP and share the PR URL and review summary with the owner. Do not merge or begin the next task.** On owner-requested corrections, update the same branch/PR, rerun tests, and stop again.
6. For the **next explicitly authorized** task, verify all required predecessor PRs are actually merged, fetch again, and branch from the newly updated `origin/main`. Independent parallel work requires explicit owner approval; multiple affected repos each need separate branches and PRs.

Never bypass CI, security gates or branch protection. Do not deploy, change secrets, mutate existing shared/local Docker data or apply migrations to data-bearing databases without separate explicit approval. A PR is a review handoff, not authorization to merge or release.

Full cross-repo protocol: [Renivet Engineering OS — W2 Codex task execution](https://github.com/renivet-platform/renivet-engineering-os/blob/main/docs/05-delivery/W2-codex-task-execution-protocol.md) (pending Engineering OS PR merger until published on `main`). Always follow this repo's stricter local policy if applicable.

## Repository-specific verification

Follow the current uv/lockfile and CI instructions. Typical baseline:

```bash
uv lock --check
uv sync --locked --extra dev
uv run --locked --extra dev ruff check .
uv run --locked --extra dev python -m pytest -q
```

Run API contract and service integration checks when touched. Document any unavailable test as **NOT EXECUTED**. Do not regenerate dependency locks, install extra infrastructure or modify production inference settings without issue scope and review.
